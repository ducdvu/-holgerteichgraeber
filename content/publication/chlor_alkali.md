#abstract = "We propose a generalized focal loss function based on the Tversky index to address the issue of data imbalance in medical image segmentation. Compared to the commonly used Dice loss, our loss function achieves a better trade off between precision and recall when training on small structures such as lesions. To evaluate our loss function, we improve the attention U-Net model by incorporating an image pyramid to preserve contextual features. We experiment on the BUS 2017 dataset and ISIC 2018 dataset where lesions occupy 4.84% and 21.4% of the images area and improve segmentation accuracy when compared to the standard U-Net by 25.7% and 3.6%, respectively."

abstract = "This paper presents a methodology for the application of receding horizon optimization techniques to the problem of optimally managing the energy flows in the chlor-alkali process using a hybrid renewable energy system (HRES). The HRES consists of solar and wind energy generation units and fuel cells to supply energy. The HRES is also connected to the grid and allows for buying or selling electricity from and to the grid. Initially, detailed models of each system component are introduced as the basis for the simulation study. Energy management strategies are then developed to realize the objectives of meeting production requirements while minimizing the overall operating and environmental costs. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses are carried out to elucidate the key parameters that influence the energy management strategies. Finally, production demand response is integrated into the proposed methodology."
